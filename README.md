The data set used is a fictitious data set published by IBM for the use of classification practice. It is incredibly hard to find an actual HR data set so this was an amazing opportunity to mess with one that models real world scenerios.

Classification Methods: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classification, General Linear Model
